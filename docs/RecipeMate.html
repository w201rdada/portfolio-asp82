<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> You open the fridge and…</h2>
<p>You come home from a long day at work and open the fridge. “What am I going to make for dinner tonight?” Figuring out what you can make with the assortment of ingredients in your kitchen is a cognitive load you just don’t need in your busy day. That’s where RecipeMate steps in to help the everyday consumer. The product tracks what you have in your fridge and suggests possible recipes that you can make.</p>

<div id="dinner-made-easy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Dinner made easy!</h2>
<p>RecipeMate works by monitoring the contents of its user’s fridge, pantry, and freezer via small cameras the user installs in those locations. It then feeds the images it captures to a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm has been trained on a vast corpus of images of groceries so it can identify the contents of the user’s kitchen. Additionally, it is able to estimate quantities based on the images it captures. The results are stored in a database users are able to access via the web or mobile or tablet application. Users can interact with the database to verify the algorithm’s matches and correct mischaracterized items. The algorithm will incorporate this user feedback to strengthen its visual matching capabilities. Additionally, users can manually input ingredients that the algorithm will be unable to identify due to “custom” packaging like leftovers stored in tupperware.</p>
<p>The contents of the user’s kitchen are then cross-referenced against a database of stored recipes that have been scraped from recipe websites such as allrecipes.com and foodnetwork.com. Results that match are returned to the user who will have the ability to filter the results based on cuisine, length of preparation time, user rating, and specific ingredients. During profile creation, the user can let RecipeMate know what type of cookware he or she possesses as well as a relative cooking skill level, so the app can calibrate the recipes it presents to the user’s capabilities. The initial recipes and recipe rating data RecipeMate will use will come from the recipe sites it scrapes. However, over time, RecipeMate will collect its own recipes and recipe ratings from its users and seek to build its own independent data.</p>
<p>As the product becomes more mature and has a larger body of user data to pull from, the product’s offerings could be expanded in several different directions. To better meet user needs, an additional layer of machine learning could be implemented to display recipe results that are most likely to meet the user’s preferences based on historical choices. Capabilities to monitor expiration dates could be added so that the app prioritizes recipes that use ingredients that will expire shortly. The app could also alert the user when food expires and needs to be tossed. Additionally, the app could be adapted to help the user with their grocery shopping experience. For example, the user could browse through the app’s archive of recipes and select one he or she would like to make. The app would then tell the user which ingredients the user does not have and add them to a shopping list. Finally, the hardware could be improved to include speech recognition capabilities so that the user can say what ingredient they are adding to the fridge, pantry, or freezer and have RecipeMate update the stored inventory list based on that rather than relying on the visual data.</p>
