Updated: 2017-11-20 The Diamond DataMine: Using Data to Find the Perfect Diamond Keywords diamonds, data, value, engagement ring, machine learning, website scraping Mo’ money, mo’ problems An engagement ring is one of the most important and expensive purchases a person will make (the average ring bought in the US costs almost $5,000)1. Engagement rings are a big business, with annual sales of $5 billion accounting for almost 20% of the diamond jewelery market 2. As anyone who has been through the process of purchasing one can attest, the experience can be stressful. Most buyers are inexperienced with the world of diamonds and jewelry. They want the purchase to be perfect as it is intended for their life partner and will last the remainder of their lifetimes. Balancing cost with quality can be very tricky for the inexperienced. Users must navigate different retailers’ sites and compare inconsistent displays of relevant data. The lack of transparent data can lead to costly mistakes and buyer’s remorse. That’s where The Diamond DataMine comes in. Mining Data The Diamond DataMine site asks users for the basic characteristics they are searching for (cut of diamond, carat, clarity, etc.) as well as a budget. It then returns diamonds that meet those criteria listed with a quality to cost ratio so that users can purchase the diamond with the best value within their price range. The site accomplishes this by scraping data from the major online retailers of diamonds (e.g. Blue Nile, Brilliant Earth). If scraping is prohibited by a retailer’s terms of use, data may be aquired through licensing deals. The Diamond DataMine model will have been taught how to value diamonds by having data on thousands of diamond appraisals fed to it before the product is launched. Data fed into the model will include but not be limited to: cut, carat, clarity, color, cost, appraisal value, physical dimensions, grading reports, ASET images, and videos of the diamond. Based on factors such as these, the platform will be able to determine the typical selling price of a diamond based on its characteristics and report to the user a composite value score relative to its price. The model will continue to collect data as time passes and will weigh recent data more heavily than older data to accurately capture current market conditions. A Diamond in the Rough The Diamond DataMine’s will simplify the diamond hunter’s search by providing a simple and easy to understand one-stop-shop solution. Limitations of the platform include inconsistent data provided by different retailers. Some provide detailed image and video data while others do not. This could cause inaccuracies in the model. Additionally, while the model will evaluate the value of the diamond relative to price, it does not take into account other factors of the diamond purchasing process such as the reputation, customer service, or return policy of the online vendor. A user will need to take these factors into account before making a final purchasing decision. However, these factors pale in comparison to the base cost of the diamond itself and the stress of navigating multiple sites, not knowing what to look for and whether or not a certain price is a good deal. The Diamond DataMine will give buyers peace of mind. https://www.weddingwire.com/press-center/press-releases/2016/weddingwire-announces-2015-newlywed-report.html↩ http://www.idexonline.com/FullArticle?Id=38054↩ "],
["RecipeMate.html", "Discover what’s for dinner You open the fridge and… Dinner made easy! Guess who’s coming to dinner", " Discover what’s for dinner Keywords easy cooking, kitchen management, recipe suggestions, machine learning You open the fridge and… You come home from a long day at work and open the fridge. “What am I going to make for dinner tonight?” Figuring out what you can make with the assortment of ingredients in your kitchen is a cognitive load you just don’t need in your busy day. That’s where RecipeMate steps in to help the everyday consumer. The product tracks what you have in your fridge and suggests possible recipes that you can make. Dinner made easy! RecipeMate works by monitoring the contents of its user’s fridge, pantry, and freezer via small cameras the user installs in those locations. It then feeds the images it captures to a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm has been trained on a vast corpus of images of groceries so it can identify the contents of the user’s kitchen. Additionally, it is able to estimate quantities based on the images it captures. The results are stored in a database users are able to access via the web or mobile or tablet application. Users can interact with the database to verify the algorithm’s matches and correct mischaracterized items. The algorithm will incorporate this user feedback to strengthen its visual matching capabilities. Additionally, users can manually input ingredients that the algorithm will be unable to identify due to “custom” packaging like leftovers stored in tupperware. The contents of the user’s kitchen are then cross-referenced against a database of stored recipes that have been scraped from recipe websites such as allrecipes.com and foodnetwork.com. Results that match are returned to the user who will have the ability to filter the results based on cuisine, length of preparation time, user rating, and specific ingredients. During profile creation, the user can let RecipeMate know what type of cookware he or she possesses as well as a relative cooking skill level, so the app can calibrate the recipes it presents to the user’s capabilities. The initial recipes and recipe rating data RecipeMate will use will come from the recipe sites it scrapes. However, over time, RecipeMate will collect its own recipes and recipe ratings from its users and seek to build its own independent data. As the product becomes more mature and has a larger body of user data to pull from, the product’s offerings could be expanded in several different directions. To better meet user needs, an additional layer of machine learning could be implemented to display recipe results that are most likely to meet the user’s preferences based on historical choices. Capabilities to monitor expiration dates could be added so that the app prioritizes recipes that use ingredients that will expire shortly. The app could also alert the user when food expires and needs to be tossed. Additionally, the app could be adapted to help the user with their grocery shopping experience. For example, the user could browse through the app’s archive of recipes and select one he or she would like to make. The app would then tell the user which ingredients the user does not have and add them to a shopping list. Finally, the hardware could be improved to include speech recognition capabilities so that the user can say what ingredient they are adding to the fridge, pantry, or freezer and have RecipeMate update the stored inventory list based on that rather than relying on the visual data. Guess who’s coming to dinner With RecipeMate as a part of the household, the days of scrambling to figure out what’s in the fridge and what to make for dinner are over. In today’s world, people spend almost four hours every week deciding what to eat 3. With RecipeMate, people can spend that time doing what they love! http://www.swnsdigital.com/2017/06/brits-spend-a-year-and-a-half-of-their-lives-deciding-what-to-eat/↩ "],
